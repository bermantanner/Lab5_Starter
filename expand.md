1. It is important for bridging between these three technologies. CSS needs to target certain selectors for styles, Javascript needs to target them for functionality.
2. Data attributes are custom attribyutes that start with data-, used to store extra information on HTML elements. In Javascript you can do something like element.dataset. With microdata, I am not entirely sure but I think it could cause clutter or mislead crawlers.
3.  A DOM fragment is a container that allows ytou to build a DOM strucutre in memory without immediately inserting it into main document. Powerful because manipulting these fragments is much faster than working directly with live DOM elements.
4.  Virtual DOM used to optimize UI rendering. I don't know what you gain or lose but upon doing some research I think that you gain performance in complex UI's, but you lose direct control over the DOM.
5.  class is reserved to define classes in object oriented code
6.  addEventListender() seems to be better overall because you can attach multiple listeners to the same event on a single element and other speicfications. I think the only advantage of onClick() is maybe being more readable.
